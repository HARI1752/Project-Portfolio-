                    <h1>Line Follower</h1>
                    <p>A line follower is a robotic system designed to autonomously navigate a predefined path by tracking a visible line on the ground. Utilizing sensors, typically infrared or reflective, the line follower detects the contrast between the surface and the line. The robot's control system interprets this data, enabling it to make real-time adjustments to its movements. Line followers find applications in various fields, from educational robotics projects to industrial automation. These robots are often employed in tasks like material handling in factories or participating in line-following competitions, where their precision and ability to follow intricate paths are put to the test. The technology behind line followers encapsulates principles of sensor integration, feedback control, and algorithmic decision-making, making it an engaging and practical introduction to the world of robotics and automation.</p>

                    <h1>Coding</h1>
                    <p>Write a program for your microcontroller that reads data from the line sensors and controls the motors to follow the line. Your code should include logic to make the robot turn left or right when it detects the line is off-center
                        Test your robot on a black line (using white background) or vice versa to ensure it can follow the path. Calibrate the sensor values and motor control logic in your program to ensure smooth line following.
                        Debug your robot's behavior and make necessary adjustments to improve its line-following accuracy.

                    <h1>Assembly</h1>
                    <p>Assemble the chassis according to the manufacturer's instructions, or design and cut your chassis from a suitable material. Attach the motors and wheels to the chassis. Make sure they are securely fastened. 
                        Mount the line sensors on the front of the chassis, facing down toward the ground. Ensure they are evenly spaced and close to the ground but not touching it.
                        Connect the motors to the motor driver board and connect the motor driver board to the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino). Wire the line sensors to the microcontroller. Typically, you'll need at least two sensors—one on each side of the robot
