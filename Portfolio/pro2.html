                    <h1>Hybrid Engine</h1>
                    <p>As the problem of fuel shortage in the modern world is increasing rapidly; 
                        The electromagnetic engines available in the market is not an efficient one as compared to the IC engines
                        Since the concept of IC engines cannot be completely eliminated, we propose a concept of hybrid engines, in which the principle of both electromagnetic and internal combustion is used.
                        The engine gives a performance equal to the present IC engines with greater fuel economy.

                    <h1>Engine</h1>
                    <p>The piston is the reciprocating part in both IC and electromagnetic part. 
                        In electromagnetic part, the piston is made on non-magnetic materials that have high resistivity and low electrical conductivity like stainless steel or aluminum. 
                        A permanent magnet made of Neodymium iron boron(ndfeb) or samarium cobalt (smco) is attached to the top and bottom of the piston. 
                        The lower side of the piston is connected to the connecting rod.

                    <p>In Starting the engine, where high torque and power is required, the IC piston will start the vehicle.
                        The power produced by the electromagnetic engine is insufficient to run a vehicle and so, the combination of IC and Electromagnetic part is used.
                        After reaching a steady state where rate of change of acceleration is minimum, the power to electromagnets is supplied by battery and both IC and electromagnetic pistons are used to run the vehicle.

                    <h1>Idealogy</h1>
                    <p>The Concept we propose is an hybrid engine which consists of Cylinders ,one with internal combustion and other with electromagnetic repulsion.
                        In Electromagnetic repulsion cylinder, the piston reciprocates by the magnetic force of attraction and repulsion produced between the electromagnets present on the top and bottom of the cylinder.
                        The permanent magnet is present on the top of piston.
                        The polarity of the coils is changed in such a way that during forward stroke of the piston, the coil at BDC repels the piston and coil at TDC attracts the piston.

                    <h1>Working</h1>
                    <p>When the engine is turned ON, it will produce high initial torque, the IC part of the engine alone operates. The ECU controls both fuel injector and power supply to the battery. The fuel is supplied to the engine during the initial stage, followed by the EME. It attains some initial torque and in order to reduce the fuel consumption, both IC and EM pistons operates at the same time to improve the performance and to reduce the load of the IC piston. When the power is supplied to the EME, the polarity of top and bottom magnetic rings is placed in such a way that it supports the movement of the piston.
